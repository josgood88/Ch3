For his book "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++", Bjarne Stroustrup created some programming exercises.
See https://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/exercise_solutions.html.
This project covers the chapter 3 exercises.  They are easy and fun.
I am not constraining myself to the chapter 3 information.
